## To improve my workflow as a UI/UX developer I thought to make this start of a color organizer React app to help me to organize swatches of my favorite colors and color schemes by their hex and rgb values. (Similar to what you might see in a stack of Pantone color swatches used by print maker--only in digital form.)

* I'm currently in the process of adding a localStorage feature to save the existing
state to brower's localStorage[]
